# biomechanics
.inypb files that include biomechanical code intended to help baseball players improve, entirely based on the Openbiomechanics data provided by Driveline Baseball.
These files are mainly code chunks without text

Openbiomechanics AI.pnypb is just that: a basic PyTorch LSTM AI framework for predicting the velocity of a pitch based on various biomechanical data

Net_zero.inypb is an attempt at a coaching strategy that is computationally net zero. It focuses on deviations in time series data that are associated with the slowest pitch/swing, with an emphasis on finding the initial/root cause of the difference
